## [v1.0.0]

#### :zap: sanilize.css renamed to ress

Before [Sanitize version 3.0.0](https://github.com/10up/sanitize.css/commit/8eb14223c1d5c928a2a51b17d4227849e7b5bdb7) be released, I was thinking about removing the description _"Merge between"_ from sanilize. Sanilize came with some deprecations that I wanted to keep and some new features that I wanted to remove.

Now with the release of [Sanitize version 4.0.0](https://github.com/10up/sanitize.css/commit/bf3d695016cbd5d17c89361d4273f3d5f69aa0ee) It's time to a new way.

Since the fork of sanitize, my goal with this project is to make a modern reset with crossbrowsers normalization. Now, **ress** has your own features and resets which you can use and customize.

The new cool features are documented in the [README](README.md/#features). The source code is clean and pretty documented, you can read it to learn something. :smile:

## [v0.7.4]

- Release a landing page :smile: - [sanilize.css](http://filipelinhares.github.io/sanilize.css/).

- Remove unnecessary comments to keep the code clean.
- Remove `list-style: none;` from `nav ul, nav ol`.
- Remove `-ms-overflow-style: -ms-autohiding-scrollbar` from `html`.

Updates from normalize 4.1.1.

### Added:

- Normalize placeholder styles in Edge, Chrome, and Safari with Firefox.
- Normalize file select buttons.
- Remove gaps in links underline in iOS 8+ and Safari 8+.

### Removed:

- Remove unnecessary specificity in inputs.

### Changed:

- Correct the outline of search inputs in Chrome and Safari.
- Limit Firefox focus normalization to buttons.

## [v0.6.3]

Updates from normalize.css 4.0.0.

### Added:

- Correct inconsistent `overflow` for `hr` in Edge and IE.
- Correct `legend` text wrapping not present in Edge and IE.

### Removed:

- Opinionated `table` resets.
